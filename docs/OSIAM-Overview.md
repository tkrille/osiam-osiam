## Functional overview

OSIAM stands for Open Source Identity & Access Management. It is a secure and
lightweight identity store that handles also processes like authentication and
authorization. OSIAM is based on open standards. These standards in combination
provide a secure way letting trusted or untrusted clients access. OSIAM is
developed with the following use cases in mind:

* secure storage of identity data for a web, cloud, mobile or legacy application
* controlled access to identity data from multiple applications
* central identity management for cloud services
* secure login (e.g. 2-factor authentication / step-up authentication)
* single sign-on for applications
* free SCIMv2 provider

### SCIM 2

SCIM ([System for Cross-domain Identity Management](http://www.simplecloud.info))
is a standard with it's second incarnation being in draft phase at the IETF.
SCIM 2 defines a [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
based interface for managing users and groups with a focus on web based
scenarios, though it is also a good choice for internal use cases to ensure
interoperability and simplicity of the solution. SCIM supports similar use cases
LDAP does, it just does not care about the storage (e.g. directory, RDBMS,
NoSQL-DB) and is made for today's decentralized internet technology. The
specification therefore also covers issues of user account provisioning and
interoperability topics with existing internet standards.

### OAuth 2

[OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) is utilized to secure the OSIAM API. OAuth is a
widely accepted standard supported by all large service providers in the
internet like Amazon, Google, LinkedIn and Salesforce [to name a few]
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth#List_of_OAuth_service_providers). With
OAuth 2 single sign-on can be implemented as well as data access authorization
for data consumer. Most of the OSIAM interfaces can only be used if the user is
authenticated against OSIAM and the user is actually authorized to make use of
the interfaces. A so called "scope" in OAuth defines a certain action or data
segment a client is allowed to access. A user gets scopes assigned so that the
client can only take actions the logged in user is authorized for. OSIAM
supports three different OAuth use cases - for detailed information please see
the [OAuth 2.0 specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749):

#### Authorization Code Grant

This is a so called "3-legged" flow and the recommended and most secure option
as the client does not get access to the user's login credentials, while it is
still being verified that the user is allowed to access data that resides in
OSIAM. In this scenario OSIAM provides the login page.
 
#### Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant

When a client can be trusted the user can provide the login credentials to the
client and the client checks OSIAM if the authentication data is correct using a
REST call. This is the less secure option for user login and authorization,
especially as the authorization is done implicit. In this scenario the client
provides the login page.

#### Client Credentials Grant

This authorization flow uses a basic authentication method to authenticate and
authorize the client. The user is not involved in this process so basically the
client is fully flexible in make API calls against OSIAM no matter what user is
logged in. This flow is not recommended and only acceptable for certain setups.

### Facebook Connect

Facebook Connect is based on OAuth 2.0 but it has some specialities. OSIAM can
act as a Service Provider for the Facebook Connect login and logout process.
That means you can easily run a Facebook Connect Service Consumer against OSIAM.
We have verified the compatibility of our Facebook Connect endpoint using
[LifeRays Facebook Connect Service Consumer](http://www.liferay.com/en/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/user-guide/-/ai/facebook-connect-sso)
implementation.

### LDAP Login

While using the [Authorization Code Grant](#authorization-code-grant) the User
can login against an LDAP server. Fore more detail information how to configure
OSIAM to use the LDAP login please see [here]
(detailed-reference-installation.md#configuring-ldap-login).

### OSIAM specific interfaces

While developing OSIAM we have the need to define interfaces that are not
currently covered by an open standard. Like the Client interface we have
developed for OSIAM before the discussion on a client interface was started in
the SCIM 2 context. We try to keep the number of OSIAM specific interfaces low
and will move to a standard based interface as soon as there is one in place. 

### Interface / endpoint overview and status

To get a basic overview of OSIAM's API the following section shows lists of the
HTTP end points OSIAM has implemented or that require implementation based on
the related standard. Additional OSIAM specific end points may be added to the
list upon implementation.

#### Authentication / authorization endpoints

## Community resources overview

Beside this overview and the README you can retrieve additional information from
various places.

### Public CI

We are using CircleCI for continuous integration: https://circleci.org/gh/osiam

### Software Quality Analytics

Our Sonar is checking static parameters of our software quality and we have
quite challenging targets for that in our Definition of Done, e.g. 0 violations
policy, >90% test coverage.

### Issue Tracker 

If you find a bug or you are missing a feature in OSIAM you can help us to
improving OSIAM by creating a ticket in our issue tracker. Also if you want to
run OSIAM on a currently not certified platform or  database, these are
important requirements for us, so please add a ticket at the tracker:
https://github.com/osiam/osiam/issues

### Repositories

The document you are reading is most likely part of OSIAM's main repository. See
what other repositories are there by pointing your browser at:
https://github.com/osiam

In each repository you should be able to find a README.md that gives you an idea
what the contents of the repository are for.

## Technical overview

Below you can find the technical prerequisites and limitations. Whenever these
are causing a problem for you either for testing and development or in
production, please let us known by creating a [ticket]
(https://github.com/osiam/osiam/issues).

### Java

OSIAM is based on Java technology utilizing parts of the Spring framework. It
is in general independent of the platform it runs on as long as the proper Java
environment is in place. We are supporting both OpenJDK 8 and Oracle Java 8.

### Operating System

OSIAM has been up and running under various operating system (Fedora, CentOS,
Windows, Debian) utilizing their available Java 8 stack.

### Databases

OSIAM uses database abstraction technologies (Hibernate) that enables us to
support a wide variety of databases. Supported Databases are PostgreSQL, MySQL
and H2. For production you should use at least either PostgreSQL 9.4 or
MySQL 5.7.
